Design patterns implemented:
	1. Stratgey Design Pattern: We implemented this pattern to be used in the Game classes pygame events loop. It uses the Strategy interface, different strategy classes, and a context class to make the decision of what strategy to execute.
	2. Factory Design Pattern: We implimented this pattern to create the different Figures classes. The FactoryClass takes in the parameters color scheme and number of blocks per figure in the create_figure method to decide on which figure class to invoke.
